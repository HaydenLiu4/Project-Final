# Project-Final
This is a choose your own adventure game that takes user input in the form of numbers. Depending on the choices the user makes, items will be added to their inventory which will decide the ending of the game.

I just used Visual Studio Code and Python to make all of this.

1. In order to run the game, create a fork.
2. Then copy the code from your fork.
3. Go to Visual Studio Code and put in "git clone (paste url you copied here)"
4. You should then see a folder appear with the project inside it.
5. In order to then run the game, make sure you're in the folder by using "cd (folder name)"
6. Then run the game as usual by typing python before whatever the project is called with a .py at the end.
7. Hopefully enjoy the game?
